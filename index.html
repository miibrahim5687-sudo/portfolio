<p>The Management, Principal, and Faculty of Dhaanish Ahmed College of Engineering cordially invite you to join our grand Pongal Celebrations, a vibrant tribute to our rich cultural heritage and the spirit of the harvest. As the sun enters the auspicious month of Thai, we come together as one family to express our heartfelt gratitude to nature and the hardworking farming community that sustains us.

The campus will transform into a traditional village square, resonating with the rhythmic beats of the Parai and the joyful cheers of "Pongalo Pongal!" Witness the ceremonial boiling of the milk and rice in earthen pots, symbolizing an abundance of prosperity for all. We encourage everyone to grace the occasion in their finest traditional ethnic attire, adding to the festive splendor. From intricate Kolam competitions to spirited folk performances, let us celebrate the bonds of unity and the sweetness of new beginnings. Join us in making this harvest festival a memorable blend of tradition, joy, and academic camaraderie. We look forward to celebrating this auspicious day with you!</p>
